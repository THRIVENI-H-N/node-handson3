What is middleware in Node.js?

The middleware in node.js is a function that will have all the access for requesting an object, responding to an object, and moving to the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle. This function can be used for modifying the req and res objects for tasks like adding response headers, parsing requesting bodies, and so on.
